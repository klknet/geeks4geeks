"""
Given a sorted array keys[0..n-1] of search keys and an array freq[0..n-1] of frequency counts, where freq[i] is the
number of searches to keys[i]. Construct a binary search tree of all keys such that the total cost of all the searches
is as small as possible.
The optimal cost for freq[0..n-1] can be recursively calculated using following formula.
optCost(i,j) = âˆ‘(k=i,j)freq[k] + min(r=i,j)[optCost(i,r-1)+optCost(r+1,j)]
We need to calculate optCost(0,n-1) to find the result.
The idea of above formula is simple, we one by one try all nodes as root(r varies from i to j in second term). When we
make rth node as root, we recursively calculate optimal cost from i to r-1 and r+1 to j. We add sum of frequencies from
i to j(see first term in above formula), this is added because every search will go through root and one comparison will
be done for every search.
