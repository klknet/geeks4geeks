"""
Make a fair coin from a biased coin.
We know foo() returns 0 with 60% probability. How can we ensure that 0 and 1 are returned with 50% probability?
If we somehow get two cases with equal probability, then we are done. We call foo two times. Both calls will return 0 with
60% probability. So the two pairs (0,1) and (1,0ï¼‰will be generated with equal probability from two calls of foo. Let us
see how.
(0,1): The probability to get 0 followed by 1 from two calls of foo() = 0.6*0.4=0.24
(1,0): The probability to get 1 followed by 0 from two calls of foo() = 0.4*0.6=0.24
So the two cases appear with equal probability. The idea is to return consider only the above two cases, return 0 in one
case, return 1 in other case. For other cases, recur until you end up in any of the above two cases.
